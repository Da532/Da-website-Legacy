# Da-website remaster

A simplistic website. Free to use as long as I'm credited. ðŸ˜Ž

## About this site

This site was created using **Bulma.io** (CSS), **Font Awesome v5** (pretty icons), **Animate.css** (a tiny portion was extracted for an entrance animation) and **A lot of self written HTML and CSS**.

This is a reskin of https://annieqwq.com which is a previous website I made. I did this as my previous site started becoming dated and I wanted something that fitted my new style of HTML. Bulma has been upgraded as has Font Awesome from v4 to v5.
